Hey, I'm Darius, a web developer located in The ~~Netherworld~~ Netherlands.  
Right now I'm in the process of setting this blog up from scratch using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)  
You can track my progress on the [Githubs](https://github.com/dkruythoff/darius-codes), and keep up with my ramblings on [Twitters](https://twitter.com/dkruythoff)
